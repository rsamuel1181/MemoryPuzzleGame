# MemoryPuzzleGame
This game was written purely for the joy of it and for me to learn more Python along the way.
The game works perfectly but without much frills and thrills. (Being a full time single dad has its tolls on being a full time nerd.)

I learnt the basics of graphics package (Pygame, FPS, event handling etc.) from http://inventwithpython.com/ - a great source for learning Python. They have the full source code for this game to be downloaded for free. But none of my code is copied from it. 

For example, I designed this to be an Object Oriented system  as opposed to the code provided in website (again, just to learn Python's OO and also to be original). I did not read the source code in the website (except gleaning through a few lines to know the basics of graphics package); nor did I refer back to it when I got stuck.. just to avoid the trap of not thinking hard enough. Of course I googled for clues (what is List Comprehension again?).

Thanks for stopping by.
